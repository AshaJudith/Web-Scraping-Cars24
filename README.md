WEB SCRAPING

INTRODUCTION:
In this mini-project, we will develop our web scraping skills by extracting and analyzing car details from Cars24.com. The focus will be on gathering data specific to the Mumbai location, including key details such as kilometers driven, year of manufacture, fuel type, transmission, and price. By the end of the project, we will gain hands-on experience in web scraping, data cleaning, and presenting structured data for analysis.

WEBSITE:
https://www.cars24.com/

PROCESS:
We used a website called Cars24.com to scrape data, utilizing libraries such as Beautiful Soup to access and extract the necessary information. After scraping the data, we wrote the program code in Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab. Subsequently, we performed a detailed analysis of the extracted data. This process helped us identify key trends and patterns in the car market. The project also enhanced our understanding of data visualization techniques to effectively present our findings.

CHALLENGES FACED:
●	Data Structure Changes: Websites frequently update their HTML structure, which can break the scraping code. Regular maintenance and updates to the scraping script are necessary to accommodate these changes.

●	Legal and Ethical Concerns: Scraping data without permission can lead to legal issues. It's important to review the website’s terms of service and ensure compliance with legal guidelines.

●	Data Cleaning: The extracted data may be unstructured or inconsistent, requiring significant cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy and usability.

SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED:
●	Data Structure Changes: We wrote flexible and modular code that can be easily adjusted when the website structure changes. Regularly monitor the website for changes in its HTML structure and update the scraping code accordingly.

●	Legal and Ethical Concerns: We Ensured compliance with the website’s terms of service and obtained necessary permissions if required. Respect the website’s policies and use the data responsibly.

●	Data Cleaning: We Develop automated cleaning scripts to clean and preprocess the data, ensuring consistency and accuracy. Implement validation checks to identify and correct inconsistencies or errors in the data.

INSIGHTS:
●	Average Price by Year:

We can Calculate the average price of Jeep Compass models for each year to see how the price varies over time.

●	Price Comparison Between Fuel Types:
We can Compare the average price of diesel vs. petrol models.

●	Mileage Analysis:
We can Examine the relationship between kilometers driven and the price.

CONCLUSION:
In conclusion, this project on web scraping data from Cars24.com to analyze Jeep Compass models has been instrumental in honing skills in data extraction, cleaning, and analysis. Through this process, valuable insights into pricing variations, market trends based on transmission types and mileage, and comparative pricing between fuel types have been uncovered. These insights not only deepen our understanding of the automotive market dynamics but also underscore the importance of data-driven decision-making in strategic business planning. Moving forward, applying these skills and insights will prove invaluable in future data-centric projects and endeavors.
